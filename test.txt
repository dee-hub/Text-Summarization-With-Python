Multilingual text classification refers to the task of trying to find the category a statement, sentence or
article belongs to. This is usually useful when trying to apply tags to articles or trying to group articles in
different categories for users. The concept of multilinguality comes into play due to the increasing
diversity in the access to the internet from non-english speakers.

For this particular project, three languages were selected English, Yoruba and Hausa.

English Text Classification

The English Dataset comprises of 200853 article headlines gotten from series of BBC News Article
Headlines. The dataset has 41 categories, namely ['CRIME', 'ENTERTAINMENT', 'WORLD NEWS',

LIVING', 'STYLE & BEAUTY', 'DIVORCE', 'WEDDINGS', 'FOOD & DRINK', 'MONEY', 'ENVIRONMENT',
'CULTURE & ARTS’].

To help the model converge quickly and accurately, the categories were reduced to four major
categories namely 'ENTERTAINMENT', 'POLITICS', 'BUSINESS', 'SCIENCE& TECHNOLOGY.

o The models used in training this dataset include BERT Transformer, Long Short Term
Memory (LSTM) and Naïve Bayes Classifier.

o The streamlined dataset with the four categories contains 58994 rows of BBC Article
Headlines.

The metrics employed for checking the accuracy of the models includes the f1_score, precision,
accuracy and recall.

The following includes the performance metric of the different models on the English dataset.
